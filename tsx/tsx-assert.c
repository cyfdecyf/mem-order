/* TSX aware assert
 * 
 * Normal assert does not work in TSX transaction. The assert output
 * is an IO operation, which causes an abort so the assert gets
 * discarded (unless it happens again when re-executed non transactionally)
 * 
 * This adds a TSX aware assert. It only works with RTM, not with HLE.
 * 
 * Operation is like normal assert.
 * Link the tsx-assert.o file to the program.
 *
 * The basic idea is to force all transactions to commit before doing the
 * the assert.
 *
 * Based on a idea by Torvald Riegel.
